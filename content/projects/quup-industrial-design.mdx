# quup: Engineering & Design for High-Performance Radiators

[Quup Heating](https://quupheating.com/en) Â· Industrial Design & Product Development

## The Opportunity

quup heating systems aimed to enter the market with a new generation of aluminum radiators that would set a new standard for both performance and design. The challenge was to create a product line that not only delivered exceptional thermal efficiency but also possessed a minimalist, architectural aesthetic that would appeal to modern interior designers and homeowners.

Key Challenges:

-   Develop a product with superior heat output compared to market competitors.
-   Design a sleek, modern, and visually appealing form factor.
-   Engineer the radiators for efficient manufacturing using aluminum extrusion.
-   Ensure flawless execution through complex CNC machining and surface finishing processes.
-   Create a cohesive design language across the entire product family.

## Our Approach

We delivered an end-to-end design and engineering solution, overseeing the project from initial concept to final production. Our integrated approach ensured that every aspect of the radiator, from its internal fluid dynamics to its external finish, was meticulously planned and executed.

### Mechanical Engineering & Thermal Analysis

Performance was paramount. We utilized advanced engineering tools to guarantee optimal heat dissipation. Using **Solidworks**, we created detailed 3D models of the radiator profiles. We then employed **Solidworks Flow Simulation** to conduct in-depth Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) analysis. This allowed us to:

-   Simulate heat transfer and fluid flow within the radiator channels.
-   Optimize the internal and external fin geometry to maximize surface area and convective heat transfer.
-   Validate design changes to improve thermal efficiency before creating physical prototypes.

### Industrial & Aesthetic Design

We worked to create a design that was both functional and beautiful. The goal was to transform a utilitarian object into a piece of interior architecture. Our design process focused on:

-   **Minimalist Form:** Creating clean lines and a slim profile that integrates seamlessly into any space.
-   **Cohesive Product Family:** Developing a consistent design language for all quup radiator models, including the Classic, Line, and Flat series.
-   **Detail-Oriented Approach:** Focusing on the quality of junctions, corners, and surfaces to communicate a premium feel.

### Prototyping & Manufacturing Support

Our involvement was completely hands-on throughout the entire manufacturing process. We designed the products with manufacturability in mind and closely supervised production to ensure our vision was realized without compromise. Our role extended beyond design to include comprehensive supply chain and process management.

-   **Aluminum Extrusion:** We designed the profiles to be perfectly suited for the extrusion process, ensuring dimensional accuracy and material integrity. This included managing the production of the extrusion dies with a trusted third-party toolmaker, [Alumat](https://alumat.it/).

-   **CNC Machining:** We worked on the CNC programming and oversight to achieve the precise details and clean finishes required by the design, ensuring tight tolerances were met consistently.

-   **Surface Finishing:** We were deeply involved in the selection and application of surface treatments, managing both anodizing for a durable, metallic finish and powder coating for a wide range of custom colors. We established strict quality control standards with our finishing partners.

-   **Assembly Design & Optimization:** The radiators were engineered for streamlined assembly. We designed custom brackets, connection points, and valve fittings to be intuitive and efficient, reducing assembly time and minimizing the chance of errors on the production line.

-   **3rd Party Tooling & Supply Management:** We took full responsibility for coordinating with external suppliers. This included sourcing high-quality components like gaskets, valves, and fasteners, as well as managing the tooling and production schedules with our manufacturing partners to ensure all parts integrated seamlessly and were available on time.

## Engineering & Design Process

Our technical workflow was built on a foundation of integration between design and engineering, ensuring every decision was validated for both performance and aesthetics.

-   **CAD/CAE:** All products were modeled and documented in **Solidworks**, creating a robust digital twin for analysis and manufacturing.
-   **CFD Analysis:** **Solidworks Flow Simulation** was critical for validating thermal performance, reducing the need for costly and time-consuming physical testing cycles.
-   **Design for Manufacturing (DFM):** We engineered the profiles to optimize material use, streamline the extrusion process, and minimize post-processing steps.
-   **Material Specification:** We specified a premium aluminum alloy (**EN AW-6060 / AlMgSi0.5**), chosen for its outstanding thermal conductivity and its ability to achieve superior anodized and powder-coated finishes.

## Results & Impact

Our comprehensive involvement resulted in a successful product launch for quup and established a strong foundation for their brand.

**High-Performance Products**
-   The final radiators deliver measurably superior thermal output, providing efficient heating and lower energy consumption for the end-user.
-   The engineering-led design has been validated by both simulation data and real-world performance.

**Strong Brand Aesthetic**
-   The minimalist, architectural design has given quup a distinct and premium identity in a crowded market.
-   The products are now specified by architects and designers who value both form and function.

**Manufacturing Efficiency**
-   Our hands-on involvement in the manufacturing phase ensured a smooth production ramp-up, with high yields and consistent quality control.
-   The DFM approach resulted in optimized production costs and reduced material waste.

## The Impact

This project is a testament to the power of integrating rigorous mechanical engineering with thoughtful industrial design. By combining advanced simulation tools with hands-on manufacturing expertise, we helped quup transform a concept into a category-leading product line. The quup radiators are not just heating elements; they are finely engineered products that deliver on the promise of high performance, efficiency, and sophisticated design, establishing the brand as a leader in modern heating solutions.
