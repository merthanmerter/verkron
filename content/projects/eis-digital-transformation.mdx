# EIS: Digital Transformation of Aluminum Extrusion Consultancy

[ExtrusionSim](https://extrusionsim.com) · A project for [Inalcom](https://inalcocompany.com) · Manufacturing Consultancy & Process Optimization

## The Opportunity

Inalcom, a leading aluminum extrusion consultancy, had built an impressive foundation of sophisticated formulations, calculations, and algorithms for optimizing extrusion processes through years of industry expertise. As their consulting practice grew and evolved, they recognized the potential to digitally transform their proven methodologies to better serve their expanding client base.

Their existing Excel-based workflows, while effective, presented opportunities for enhancement. Inalcom sought to leverage modern technology to amplify their consulting capabilities, enabling them to serve more clients simultaneously while maintaining their high standards of precision and expertise. They envisioned providing clients with real-time access to process optimization recommendations, moving beyond traditional consulting delivery methods to offer immediate, interactive solutions.

Additionally, Inalcom wanted to offer their expertise in a format that could be deployed directly at client facilities, providing secure, on-premises access to their optimization methodologies within clients' local networks. They aimed to ensure their proven methodologies could be consistently applied across all client engagements through a unified digital platform.

We collaborated closely with Inalcom throughout their digital transformation journey, helping them evolve their established expertise into a cutting-edge web application that could be deployed at client facilities worldwide. Our role was to provide the technical architecture and modern development approach that would bring their proven methodologies into the digital age.

## The Technology

We built EIS using a modern, performance-focused technology stack designed for reliability and ease of deployment. The backend foundation leverages Bun runtime for high-performance JavaScript execution, implemented with Hono web framework and tRPC for type-safe API development. We used PostgreSQL database with Drizzle ORM for robust, type-safe data operations.

For the frontend development, we built a React-based user interface with TanStack Router for seamless navigation, TanStack Query for efficient data management and caching, and shadcn/ui component library for consistent, accessible design.

The application compiles to a single binary for simplified installation and offers multi-platform compatibility across Windows, Linux, and macOS. This enables local server deployment capability for secure, on-premises installation at client facilities, while maintaining connection to **Inalcom's calculation APIs** for the core optimization algorithms.

```
async function getOptimalSettings(input) {
  const res = await fetch("https://api.extrusionsim.com/v1/simulate", {
    method: "POST",
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
      'API-Key': process.env.INALCOM_API_KEY
    },
    body: JSON.stringify(input)
  })
  return res.json()
}
```

### Core Application Features

EIS implements Inalcom's proprietary algorithms through an advanced process simulation engine that analyzes die-alloy-press combinations to generate optimized parameters including temperatures, ram speeds, billet calculations, and cost analysis. The application features comprehensive equipment and material management for presses, aluminum alloys (1000-7000 series), and die inventory with technical documentation.

The system provides recipe-based production planning that combines die specifications, alloy selection, and target parameters with operator guidance. Integrated quality control enables production issue tracking, process corrections, and institutional knowledge capture for continuous improvement.

Advanced optimization workflows support multi-scenario analysis for new product development, cost reduction, quality improvement, and press scheduling. The platform enables data-driven decision making through what-if analysis, equipment comparison, and comprehensive production metrics tracking.

## Technical Innovation & Results

We successfully digitized Inalcom's years of industry expertise into automated, consistent algorithms while maintaining precision and accuracy. The solution features type-safe development from database to frontend, single binary deployment for simplified installation, and flexible architecture that works across different client environments.

The transformation enabled Inalcom to serve multiple clients simultaneously with consistent, automated process optimization, significantly expanding their consulting capacity. What previously required manual calculations can now be completed in minutes with immediate results. Clients receive a complete, self-contained optimization system for local deployment, providing ongoing value while maintaining security and control over their production data.

## The Impact

This project demonstrates how deep industry expertise can be successfully transformed into modern, deployable software solutions. By respecting Inalcom's proven methodologies while implementing them in a cutting-edge technical stack, we created a solution that:

- Preserves decades of specialized knowledge in a digital format
- Enables rapid scaling of consultancy services
- Provides clients with long-term value through on-premises deployment
- Maintains the precision and reliability of established manual processes

The result is a powerful example of how traditional industrial expertise can be enhanced and scaled through thoughtful software development, creating value for both the consultancy and their manufacturing clients.

## Company Websites

We also built the corporate websites for **[Inalcom](https://inalcocompany.com)** and **[ExtrusionSim](https://extrusionsim.com)** using a modern technology stack including Next.js, TypeScript, Hono, shadcn/ui, Drizzle ORM, Neon Database, Better Auth, TanStack Query, GSAP, and next-intl. This carefully selected stack ensures type-safe development, robust API endpoints, secure authentication, efficient data caching, seamless animations, multi-language support, and blazing-fast database operations—all while maintaining a beautiful, consistent user interface.
